vg-java-jsonparser
==================

JSON objects are built by class constructors in a simple, easy-to-read and easy-to-extend format. The actual JSON parsing to build the objects is performed by the JsonParser class. The whole parse operation is done in a single pass of the JSON string; combining these elements makes this a fast, lightweight, low-resource-intensive JSON parser.

For an example implementation leveraging this library in production code, see: https://bitbucket.org/stormont/vg-java-mapquestjson
